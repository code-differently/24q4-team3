## Virtual Closet Organizer 

### Problem(s)

- __Wardrobe Overload:__ People often own a lot of clothes but struggle to keep track of their wardrobe or decide on outfits quickly.
- __Wasted Time:__ Finding the right outfit each day can be time-consuming, especially with changing weather (during the season) and various occasions.
- __Lack of Weather Context:__ Choosing clothes without considering the weather can lead to discomfort or being unprepared for the day.
- __Inspiration Challenges:__ People want to feel confident and inspired by their outfits, but donâ€™t always know how to put together looks with what they have.

### The solution
This repository here acts as a virtual closet that lets users store, manage, and plan outfits, while also receiving suggestions based on weather. 
The few core features include:
- Organize and categorize clothing items with details 
- Create and save outfits from closet items
- Get weather-based suggestions for outfit ideas

Room for improvement would be more advancements like outfit filterinng (based on color or style combinations) , Additional outfit recommendations based on fashion trends, Having outfits planned for the week 
that includes a laundry status (enum) to determine whether an outfit is available to use or not
